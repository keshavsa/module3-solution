                <p id="section1">Chicken</p>
                Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisinesOriginally raised
                for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
                Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[5] There are
                numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature. Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in

                <p id="section2">Beef</p>
                Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today,
                beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef. Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak,
                which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated
                with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural
                product.

                her studies after she was expelled for political activism promoting Golput (Golongan Putih, or blank ballot in protest of the Golkar Party's dominance making Indonesia a One-party state), a movement which was banned under then President
                Suharto's New Order.[5] Pudjiastuti was the first Indonesian minister to have never completed a high school education,[6] although after she became a government minister, she enrolled for a late high school programme (Paket C), and she
                officially graduated in 2018.[7] <a href="#top"> Go to top</a>
